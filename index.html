	<p>Hi! My name is Brandon Hoenig, and I am a PhD Candidate at Duquesne University. I utilize molecular ecology techniques, such as DNA Metabarcoding and Stable Isotope Analysis, to study the diet and development of nestling Louisiana waterthrush. I also have a passion for data visualization and lead workshops detailing the programming language, R, and how to use it to make publication-ready figures.</p>
